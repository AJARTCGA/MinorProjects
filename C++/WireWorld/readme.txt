WireWorld Implementation - Austin Ferguson 8/4/2017

Stumbled upon the cellular automata WireWorld by Brian Silverman and decided to create a quick implementation. 
More info on WireWorld here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld
The other reason for creating this was to try SFML and refamiliarize myself with vim and Ubuntu in general. 

Controls:
	Left Mouse: Place a conductor
	Right Mouse: Remove anything in the cell
	Middle Mouse: Place an electron head
	Space: Pause/Resume (Starts paused)
	Enter: Advance one step, if paused
	Escape: Exit
	C: Clear the entire world
	R: Remove the current, all electrons become conductors
	G: Toggle the grid

There are plenty of bugs, as this was a simple afternoon exercize and my first time with SFML.
The worst problem though, has to be the indentation. Vim's tabs and I don't get along...
